						Now, to start talking about media archaeology, we need to look at the past to learn from the present. 
						When the Pokewalker came out back in 2009, it was the norm for people to have several different devices that accomplished different tasks, 
						people would have a phone, and music player like an iPod, and that was the norm. Nowadays everybody has 1 device that does everything, so 
						having the Pokewalker be seperate from the device you play games on isn't what people want anymore, people don't want to have all these different devices, 
						they want things in one place.
					</aside>

				<h2></h2>

					<aside class="notes">
						Another thing people need in their devices is connectivity, we need only look at the success of Pokemon GO to know this, people want to do things with their friends,
						together. But once again, back in 2009, being constantly online wasn't commonplace, the internet was still coming into its own and slowly becoming accepted, finding its place
						in the world, but nowadays everyone is constantly online, and companies push that. The Pokewalker being an offline device with no cooperative features was okay then, but not
						okay now, which would cause the Pokewalker to fail when trying to compete with Pokemon GO were it still alive today.

					<aside class="notes">
						Another thing that we need today is longevity in our devices, and thats not even an issue from back in 2009 that is commonplace now, longevity is required for things to 
						succeed and not fall into obscurity like the Pokewalker did. Pokemon GO has managed to keep itself alive through constant updates, special events, and having the ability 
						to play with friends. The Pokewalker has none of these features, you could "beat" the Pokewalker in 200 days if you maxed out its progress everyday, and obtain everything 
						it could offer, and Nintendo couldn't exactly update it to add more to do. So it fell into obscurity.

					<aside class="notes">
						Now, I've talked a lot about what the Pokewalker did wrong, but it also did quite a bit right that can be seen even today. People love having apps that encourage them to do things, 
						look at the success of Duolingo for example, which encourages you to learn languages by obtaining points and having a virtual bird squawk at you until you do your spanish lessons, 
						or Pokemon GO which encourages you to go outside and walk to landmarks and go for long runs to hatch eggs, these things can all be seen in the Pokewalker, that encourages you to be 
						active by rewarding you with leveling your Pokemon up and giving you currency to catch new Pokemon.

				<h2></h2>

					<aside class="notes">
						So as we can see, looking at the past the Pokewalker did a lot of good for its time, but those things don't hold up in todays day and age, however that doesn't mean the Pokewalker 
						has no potential, with some tweaking, Quality of Life fixes, and a new platform that encourages online play, I think that the Pokewalker has a lot of potential, which will lead me 
						into my next points, detailing my hypothetical evolution for the Pokwalker, and how it can survive in todays society, even with Pokemon GO existing beside it.
