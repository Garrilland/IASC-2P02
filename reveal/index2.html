						Now, to start talking about media archaeology, we need to look at the past to learn from the present. 
						When the Pokewalker came out back in 2009, it was the norm for people to have several different devices that accomplished different tasks, 
						people would have a phone, and music player like an iPod, and that was the norm. Nowadays everybody has 1 device that does everything, so 
						having the Pokewalker be seperate from the device you play games on isn't what people want anymore, people don't want to have all these different devices, 
						they want things in one place.

					<aside class="notes">
						Another thing people need in their devices is connectivity, we need only look at the success of Pokemon GO to know this, people want to do things with their friends,
						together. But once again, back in 2009, being constantly online wasn't commonplace, the internet was still coming into its own and slowly becoming accepted, finding its place
						in the world, but nowadays everyone is constantly online, and companies push that. The Pokewalker being an offline device with no cooperative features was okay then, but not
						okay now, which would cause the Pokewalker to fail when trying to compete with Pokemon GO were it still alive today.
