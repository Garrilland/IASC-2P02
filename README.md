# IASC-2P02 | Gary Gullage

## Bio

Hello there! My name is Gary Gullage, I am a 2nd year IASC student, and my main area of interest within the digital humanities is cultural studies, specifically I do a lot of studying into video games, and the culture surrounding them. The best example of this is my Research Presentation going over the history and features of the Pokéwalker, and the possible evolution of it. And of course to show that my main interest is in this kind of research, I chose my Pokéwalker presentation as my featured project, and revised it using the provided feedback so it can be the best it can be, to nail home my ideas and support them with evidence. I hope to eventually get a job in the field of Video Games, and learning from the past of video games is how one innovates them, so by looking at what people have tried and failed to do, as well as the things that have succeeded, will allow me to create the unique and innovative ideas that drive the field forwards.

## Featured Presentation: The Pokéwalker

For my Research Presentation, I did an in-depth research project of the Pokéwalker, which was a pedometer device that was released alongside Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver, and offered several benefits for using it alongside the 2 games, such as exclusive Pokémon, rare items, and it allowed you to level up the Pokémon by going for walks. Along with going over its history and features, I also talked a lot about its relationship with it's sort of spiritual successor, Pokémon GO, and alos talked about a hypothetical evolution of the product, using my own ideas, which was to release it alongside another Nintendo product, Streetpass on the 3DS, which would not only allow the product to not die like the Pokéwalker did, but survive and not need to compete with Pokémon GO, having it fill a different role than what GO does. My hypothetical evolution fixes its main issues, like price and obtainability,  adds Quality of Life changes, such as removing its batteries and making it an app rather than its own device, requiring infrared connection rather than easily tranfering within a system, and encourages longevity by not restricting its use to only 2 games, learning from the past to fix the future.


The main complaints that I received from my instructor feedback, was that I didn't include enough media archaeological thinking, and that I sacrificed that thinking in favor of explaining the features of the Pokewalker, but other than that I received pretty good marks, so in the 5 new slides I created, I focused entirely on fleshing out my media archaeology for the Pokewalker, talking about it from the POV of today, with todays technology and the technology of the time in mind, and used those new ideas to reinforce my other ideas, talking about how we can learn from the Pokewalkers mistakes and the things it did right. I looked back at how back in 2009 people had like 4 devices for seperate functions, which was fine for then, but now everyone has everything on their smartphones, [as you can see here](https://i.imgur.com/bbRgJWC.png). I looked at how the internet has evolved to a point where everyone always wants to be online, but back in 2009, when the internet was still finding its legs, people were fine with being offline, [as you can see here](https://i.imgur.com/RReg4Wt.png). I also talked about the Pokewalker in relation to similar applications that encourage the user to do activities, like Pokemon GO which encourages going for walks just like the Pokewalker did, as well as other apps like Duolingo, [as you can see here](https://i.imgur.com/RReg4Wt.png). I learned a lot through this new research, about how some tech works in the time it was made, but fall into obscurity as new things become available that do their thing better with new features that appeal to the time it was made.

## Collaborative Project

For my Collaborative Presentation project, Shavon, Arijit, and I all researched the humanities tool known as Scalar, a program for making easy digital scholarship books, that enables the user to assemble media from various sources all into their project with ease, such as creating annotated media. My role in the presentation was to go into the tool and build something with it, and my findings basically just reinforced what we read from the description the website gave us of Scalar, it was easy to put together various sources into one presentation using the tools that Scalar provide to the user.

My approach to collaborative scholarship for this project was pretty simple for this project in particular, we all met up shortly after we were given the assignment, we talked about the project and the tool we chose to research, we all assigned each other a task to accomplish, and we just kept each other up to date with the project and then presented. The thing that I like most about collaboration is knowing the weight of an assignment isn't entirely on my shoulder, knowing that I have people around me not only helping me reach the same goal, but knowing that I don't need to do the whole assignment by myself is incredibly freeing and relieves a lot of the stress of a project. Rather than having to do all the research  about what scalar is, who made it, what it's for, and the theoretical discussion behind Scalar, I only had to focus on research using the tool, [which you can see here](https://i.imgur.com/4KFgbY8.png). So we all met up, [started a Facebook Messenger discussion to stay in touch](https://i.imgur.com/NIPfcbB.png), and we worked on our respective parts. Having multiple people to bounce ideas off of is very helpful in any academic environment, not just digital humanities, we could always ask the other members of the group if they could read over our slides to [provide feedback](https://i.imgur.com/id9zGVf.png), and overall I believe that group projects end up better because of it, for the same reason that a project is always better after peer reviewed feedback is provided, you can ask others for advice and review, and apply it, to provide stronger work.
