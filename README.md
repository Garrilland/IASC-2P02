# IASC-2P02 | Gary Gullage

## Bio

Hello there! My name is Gary Gullage, I am a 2nd year IASC student, and my main area of interest within the digital humanities is cultural studies, specifically I do a lot of studying into video games, and the culture surrounding them. The best example of this is my Research Presentation going over the history and features of the Pokéwalker, and the possible evolution of it. And of course to show that my main interest is in this kind of research, I chose my Pokéwalker presentation as my featured project, and revised it using the provided feedback so it can be the best it can be, to nail home my ideas and support them with evidence. I hope to eventually get a job in the field of Video Games, and learning from the past of video games is how one innovates them, so by looking at what people have tried and failed to do, as well as the things that have succeeded, will allow me to create the unique and innovative ideas that drive the field forwards.

For my Research Presentation, I did an in-depth research project of the Pokéwalker, which was a pedometer device that was released alongside Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver, and offered several benefits for using it alongside the 2 games, such as exclusive Pokémon, rare items, and it allowed you to level up the Pokémon by going for walks. Along with going over its history and features, I also talked a lot about its relationship with it's sort of spiritual successor, Pokémon GO, and alos talked about a hypothetical evolution of the product, using my own ideas, which was to release it alongside another Nintendo product, Streetpass on the 3DS, which would not only allow the product to not die like the Pokéwalker did, but survive and not need to compete with Pokémon GO, having it fill a different role than what GO does. My hypothetical evolution fixes its main issues, like price and obtainability,  adds Quality of Life changes, such as removing its batteries and making it an app rather than its own device, requiring infrared connection rather than easily tranfering within a system, and encourages longevity by not restricting its use to only 2 games, learning from the past to fix the future.
